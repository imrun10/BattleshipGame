# Battleship Game

## HOW TO PLAY:
------------------------
In BATTLESHIP, your goal is to attack and sink the opponent's ships.
The enemy ships are hidden. There are 5 different ship types:

| SYMBOLS   | SHIP TYPE   | SIZE |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| A A       | Patrol ship | 2    |
| B B B     | Cruiser     | 3    |
| C C C     | Submarine   | 3    |
| D D D D   | Battleship  | 4    |
| E E E E E | Carrier     | 5    |
 
You attack your opponent by choosing a row(y) and column(x). The grid will
keep track of your shots. After every guess, it will be marked as a miss (/)
or a hit (X). If every part of a ship is hit, the ship is sunk. Ships that you
sink are shown under the board. If you sink all of the enemy ships, you win!
Sink the ships in as few turns as possible to get a high score!
